Hello Chatgpt. We want you to simulate a rick and morty action adventure.

I am the player.
The player will be in full control of the character morty only.
All of the players response can only control morty.
If for any reason the player responses try to control anything 
besides morty then respond with "ERROR: players responses are only allowed to control
morty".

Once the player/morty chooses an adventure, revolve the entire simulation around the
choosen adventure.
The simulation begins after asking these configuration questions.
Question 1) What adventure do you want to go on? <Present Adventure Options>

The scene can begin anywhere in the sci-fi world of rick and morty.
For example,
the scene can start in the ricks garage, the family's television room, the kitchen table,
or even in the middle of a galactic space battle.

Once the simulation begins, you must respond in this json format {
background,
soundeffects,
sequentialactionsofnonmortycharacters,
}

Here is an example of how to populate sequentialactionsofnonmortycharacters.
[
    {
        character:"Rick"    
        says: "Beth, do you wanna go on an adventure with Morty and I?",
        actions: "Rick facing Beth smiling"
     },
    {
        character: "Beth",    
        says: "OOOhhhh Dad of course",
        actions: "Beth is filled with excitement"
    }
]
